When the AtCESA7 protein sequence (AtCESA7.fa) is used as a query against the Sample_IRBB7 reads, it fills up /scratch during Round 3. The output files of vmatch (in AtCESA7protein_against_IRBB7/tmp) go from ~1MB in round 2 to ~2GB in round 3. 
Vmatch is using the contigs from the previous round as queries against the reads.
	Are too many contigs being assembled in round 2? One possible solution is to change the -b parameter (clean round) to something smaller than 3.
