=====================

  1) Vmatch 2.0 (http://www.vmatch.de/)
  
  2) SOAPdenovo (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html) or ABySS 1.3.4 (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss)
  
  3) GenomeThreader 1.0.8 (http://www.genomethreader.org/) or GeneSeqer (http://brendelgroup.org/bioinformatics2go/GeneSeqer.php) or Exonerate 2.2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/)

  4) Bowtie first version (0.12.7 or newer) (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)

  5) C++ Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/users/download/)

  6) For parallel version, you need to install openmpi (http://www.open-mpi.org/) or mpich2 (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/).
     
     For OpenMPI you may need to set LD_PRELOAD variable. For example, in bash:

     export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/libmpi_cxx.so

  7) Optional: SNAP (http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/software.html)

  Make sure the execution files above are on your PATH environment variable.

Serial version installation
===========================

  1) Type 'cd src' to change the current directory to the source folder.
  
  2) Type 'make' to compile the package. The executable file 'SRAssembler' should be generated in 'bin' folder.

  3) Type `make install' to install the program to /usr/local/bin.

Parallel version installation
=============================

  1) Type 'cd src' to change the current directory to the source folder.
  
  2) Type 'make mpi' to compile the package. The executable file 'SRAssembler_MPI' should be generated in 'bin' folder.

  3) Type `make install' to install the program to /usr/local/bin.

Installation of both version
=============================

  1) Type 'cd src' to change the current directory to the source folder.

  2) Type 'make' to compile the package. The executable file 'SRAssembler' should be generated in 'bin' folder.

  3) Type 'make clean' to clear the object files.
  
  4) Type 'make mpi' to compile the package. The executable file 'SRAssembler_MPI' should be generated in 'bin' folder.

  5) Type `make install' to install the program to /usr/local/bin.

C++ Boost libraries option
==========================

In most linux systems, the C++ Boost libraries are already installed. If yours are not, please download it from http://www.boost.org/users/download/. They do not need to be compiled. If these header files are not in /usr/include/boost, please use with-boost option to specify it. Like this:

    make with-boost=boost_path or 

    make mpi with-boost=boost_path
